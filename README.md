# AES-chat
This is a project intended to demonstrate the use of key exchange and encryption in a simple chat program. It establishes a shared encryption key with each connecting client through a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which the client and server then use to encrypt and decrypt each-other's messages via AES.
